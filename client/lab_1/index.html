    Let's Try Some Inline Elements
</h2>

<p>
    Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something </em>in a line of text.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes you want to <b>emphasize something</b>  in the text.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes you want to <b><em>do both.</em></b> 
</p>

<h2>
    Empty Elements
</h2>

<p>
    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything<br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<hr>
</p>

<h2>
    Images 
</h2>

<p>
    Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
</p>

<img src='images/mochi.jpg'/>
<img src='images/mochi.gif'/>
<img src='images/mochi.png'/>
<img src='images/mochi.svg'/>
