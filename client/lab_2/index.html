   <h2>First, the basics.</h2> 
    
   <p>You need the following to build your website.</p> 
    
    <div class = 'section_1'>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>
               
        <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
            <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
            <li>Learn how to work with others in a technical space</li>
            <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class = 'section_2'>
        <h2 class ='subtitle'>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
            
        
        
        Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
        
        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
        
        Sometimes you want to do both.

    </div>


    
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    
    <p>
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything<br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<hr>
    </p>
    
    <div class= 'section_3'>
        <h2>Images</h2> 
        Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
        If you build this page right, your images will form a small "carousel"
